/**
 * \ingroup routing
 * \defgroup aodv AODV
 * 
 * This model implements the base specification of the Ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV)
 * protocol. Implementation is based on RFC3561.
 *
 * Class aodv::RoutingProtocol implements all functionality of service packet exchange and inherits Ipv4RoutingProtocol. 
 * Base class defines two virtual functions for packet routing and forwarding.  The first one,
 * RouteOutput(), is used for locally originated packets, and the second one, RouteInput(), is used for forwarding
 * and/or delivering received packets.
 *
 * Protocol operation depends on the many adjustable parameters. Parameters for this functionality are attributes of
 * aodv::RoutingProtocol. We support parameters, with their default values, from RFC and parameters that enable/disable
 * protocol features, such as broadcasting HELLO messages, broadcasting data packets and so on.
 *
 * AODV discovers routes on demand. Therefore, our AODV model  buffer all packets, while a route request packet (RREQ)
 * is disseminated. We implement a packet queue in aodv-rqueue.cc. Smart pointer to packet, Ipv4RoutingProtocol::ErrorCallback,
 * Ipv4RoutingProtocol::UnicastForwardCallback and IP header are stored in this queue. The packet queue implements garbage collection of old
 * packets and a queue size limit.
 *
 * Routing table implementation support garbage collection of old entries and state machine, defined in standard.
 * It implements as a STL map container. The key is a destination IP address.
 *
 * Some moments of protocol operation aren't described in RFC. This moments generally concern cooperation of different OSI model layers.
 * We use following heuristics:
 * 
 * 1) This AODV implementation can detect the presence of unidirectional links and avoid them if necessary.
 *    If the node we received a RREQ for is a neighbor we are probably facing a unidirectional link... 
 *    This heuristic is taken from AODV-UU implementation and can be disabled.
 *    
 * 2) Protocol operation strongly depends on broken link detection mechanism. We implements two such heuristics.
 *    First, this implementation support  HELLO messages. However HELLO messages are not a good way to do neighbor sensing
 *    in a wireless environment (at least not over 802.11). Therefore, you may experience bad performance when running over wireless.
 *    There are several reasons for this:
 *      -# HELLO messages are broadcasted. In 802.11, broadcasting is done at a lower bit rate than unicasting,
 *         thus HELLO messages travel further than data.
 *      -# HELLO messages are small, thus less prone to bit errors than data transmissions.
 *      -# Broadcast transmissions are not guaranteed to be bidirectional, unlike unicast transmissions.
 *    Second, we use layer 2 feedback when possible. Link considered to be broken, if frame transmission results in a transmission 
 *    failure for all retries. This mechanism meant for active links and work much more faster, than first method.
 *    Layer 2 feedback implementation relies on TxErrHeader trace source, currently it is supported in AdhocWifiMac only.
 *    
 * 3) Duplicate packet detection. We use special class DuplicatePacketDetection for this purpose.
 *
 * Following optional protocol optimizations aren't implemented:
 *  - Expanding ring search.
 *  - Local link repair.
 *  - RREP, RREQ and HELLO message extensions.
 * This techniques require direct access to IP header, which contradict assertion from AODV RFC that AODV works over UDP. Our model use UDP
 * for simplicity, but this disable us to implement protocol optimizations. We don't use low layer raw socket, because they are not portable.
