Conclusion
----------

Futures
*******

This document is a work in process.  We hope and expect it to grow over time
to cover more and more of the nuts and bolts of |ns3|.  

We hope to add the following chapters over the next few releases:

* The Callback System
* The Object System and Memory Management
* The Routing System
* Adding a New NetDevice and Channel
* Adding a New Protocol
* Working with Real Networks and Hosts

Writing manual and tutorial chapters is not something we all get excited about,
but it is very important to the project.  If you are an expert in one of these
areas, please consider contributing to |ns3| by providing one of these
chapters; or any other chapter you may think is important.

Closing
*******

|ns3| is a large and complicated system.  It is impossible to cover all 
of the things you will need to know in one small tutorial.

We have really just scratched the surface of |ns3| in this tutorial, 
but we hope to have covered enough to get you started doing useful networking 
research using our favorite simulator.

-- The |ns3| development team.
