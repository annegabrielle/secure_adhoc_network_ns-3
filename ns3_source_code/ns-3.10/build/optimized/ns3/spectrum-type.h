 * This class represent a type of signal that can be transmitted by
 * SpectrumPhy instances over a SpectrumChannel. By means of this
 * class a SpectrumPhy is able to recognize which type of signals it
 * is able to decode (i.e., receive) and which are to be considered
 * only as a source of interference. Note that this distinction of
 * signal types is an abstraction which is introduced only for
 * simulation purposes: in the real world a device needs to infer
 * whether a signal is of a known type by examining at properties of the
 * signal, such as preamble, CRC fields, etc.
