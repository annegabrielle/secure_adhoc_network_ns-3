 * This class allows for creation of multiple threads of execution in a
 * process.  The exact implementation of the thread functionality is 
 * operating system dependent, but typically in ns-3 one is using an 
 * environment in which Posix Threads are supported (either navively or
 * in the case of Windows via Cygwin's implementation of pthreads on the 
 * Win32 API.  In either case we expect that these will be kernel-level
 * threads and therefore a system with multiple CPUs will see truly concurrent 
 * execution.

 * Synchronization between threads is provided via the SystemMutex class.

  /**
   * @brief Create a SystemThread object.
   *
   * A system thread object is not created running.  A thread of execution
   * must be explicitly started by calling the Start method.  When the 
   * Start method is called, it will spawn a thread of execution and cause
   * that thread to call out into the callback function provided here as
   * a parameter.
   *
   * Like all ns-3 callbacks, the provided callback may refer to a function
   * or a method of an object depending on how the MakeCallback function is
   * used.
   *
   * The most common use is expected to be creating a thread of execution in
   * a method.  In this case you would use code similar to,
   *
   *   MyClass myObject;
   *   Ptr<SystemThread> st = Create<SystemThread> (
   *     MakeCallback (&MyClass::MyMethod, &myObject));
   *   st->Start ();
   *
   * The SystemThread is passed a callback that calls out to the function
   * MyClass::MyMethod.  When this function is called, it is called as an
   * object method on the myObject object.  Essentially what you are doing
   * is asking the SystemThread to call object->MyMethod () in a new thread
   * of execution.
   *
   * If starting a thread in your currently executing object, you can use the
   * "this" pointer:
   *
   *   Ptr<SystemThread> st = Create<SystemThread> (
   *     MakeCallback (&MyClass::MyMethod, this));
   *   st->Start ();
   *
   * Object lifetime is always an issue with threads, so it is common to use
   * smart pointers.  If you are spinning up a thread in an object that is 
   * managed by a smart pointer, you can use that pointer directly:
   *
   *   Ptr<MyClass> myPtr = Create<MyClass> ();
   *   Ptr<SystemThread> st = Create<SystemThread> (
   *     MakeCallback (&MyClass::MyMethod, myPtr));
   *   st->Start ();
   *
   * Just like any thread, you can synchronize with its termination.  The 
   * method provided to do this is Join (). If you call Join() you will block
   * until the SystemThread run method returns.
   *
   * @param callback entry point of the thread
   * 
   * @warning The SystemThread uses SIGALRM to wake threads that are possibly
   * blocked on IO.
   * @see Shutdown
   *
   * @warning I've made the system thread class look like a normal ns3 object
   * with smart pointers, and living in the heap.  This makes it very easy to
   * manage threads from a single master thread context.  You should be very
   * aware though that I have not made Ptr multithread safe!  This means that
   * if you pass Ptr<SystemThread> around in a multithreaded environment, it is
   * possible that the reference count will get messed up since it is not an
   * atomic operation.  CREATE AND MANAGE YOUR THREADS IN ONE PLACE -- LEAVE
   * THE PTR THERE.

   * time as its job is done (typically when the simulation is done).  We then 
   * want the thread to exit itself.  This method provides a consistent way for
   * the managing thread to communicate with the managed thread.  After the

   *
   * This alone isn't really enough to merit these events, but in Unix, if a
   * worker thread is doing blocking IO, it will need to be woken up from that
   * read somehow.  This method also provides that functionality, by sending a
